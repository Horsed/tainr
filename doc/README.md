*tainr* is ought to be an event-based monitoring service that aims for high customizability. It will enable you to monitor anything from process metrics to business events. You can write your own monitoring indicators and handlers (called drones) which are basically just Node.js modules that use the same interprocess ```EventEmitter```. Indicators are those parts that test/monitor something and send monitoring events. Handlers will listen for those events and send emails or log something or do whatever you want. tainr will provide a [socket.io](http://socket.io) integration so you can even write handlers that do something **in your frontend**. The underlying messaging is based on [zeromq](http://zeromq.org) so you can connect tainr to your existing zeromq based pub/sub infrastructure. This makes it easy to monitor all events going through your app. You can also let tainr use its own pub/sub infrastructure.
